What does it actually do?
================
This plugin simply creates / modifies animations in an `AnimationPlayer` that change the `offset` and `region_rect` properties of a `Sprite`/`Sprite3D` node based on the animation tags of a Sprite Sheet JSON data file generated by Aseprite. For a more in-depth explanation see this [code](https://github.com/hectorid/aseprite_importer/blob/master/addons/aseprite_importer/classes/AsepriteImporter.gd).

Download and Installation
=================
1. Download or clone [this repository](https://github.com/hectorid/aseprite_importer) and copy the `/addons/aseprite_importer` folder into your `project/addons` folder
2. In the Godot Editor, go to **Projects -> Project Settings...** and enable the plugin in the Plugins tab

Usage
====
Exporting from Aseprite
-----------------------------
1. In Aseprite, go to **File -> Export Sprite Sheet**
2. Configure how you want the Sprite Sheet image to be exported
3. In the **Output** section:
   - Enable the option **Output File** and select the directory where you want the texture file to be saved;
   - Enable the option **JSON Data** and select the directory where you want the JSON data file to be saved (preferably in the same directory of the image)
   - Enable the option **Meta -> Tags**

Importing to Godot
----------------------
1. Open the scene where you want to import the animations
2. Select the JSON Data file
3. Select the texture file if it has not been automatically loaded
4. Select which tags you want to be imported
5. Select the `AnimationPlayer` node where you want the animations to be added/modified
6. Select The `Sprite`/`Sprite3D` node you want to be affected by the animations

Limitations
=======
- For now the plugin doesn't keep track of the selected files in the disk to automatically re-import the changes;
- It also is not integrated with the Godot's UndoRedo system.
