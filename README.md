What does it actually do?
================
This plugin simply creates / modifies animations in an `AnimationPlayer` that change the `offset` and `region_rect` properties of a `Sprite`/`Sprite3D` node based on the animation tags of a Sprite Sheet JSON data file generated by Aseprite. For a more in-depth explanation see this [code](https://github.com/hectorid/aseprite_importer/blob/master/addons/aseprite_importer/classes/AsepriteImporter.gd).

Download and Installation
=========================
Downloading from the Godot Asset Library
----------------------------------------
1. In the Godot editor, open the **AssetLib** tab
2. Search for `Aseprite Importer`
3. Click on the asset name and click the **Download** button in the preview window
4. After the download is finished, click **Instal...** and then **Install** in the popup
5. Go to **Projects -> Project Settings...** and enable the plugin in the **Plugins** tab

Downloading from the GitHub repository
--------------------------------------
1. Download or clone [this repository](https://github.com/hectorid/aseprite_importer) and copy the `/addons/aseprite_importer` folder into your `project/addons` folder
2. In the Godot Editor, go to **Projects -> Project Settings...** and enable the plugin in the **Plugins** tab

Usage
====
To use your `.aseprite` spritesheets, the program needs a `.json` (and `.png`) file generated by aseprite itself. There's two ways to get this files: using the plugin or the program (manually). Exporting by using the program manually is preferred, as it has more features, and is more foolproof.


Exporting from Aseprite
-----------------------------
1. In Aseprite, go to **File -> Export Sprite Sheet**
2. Configure how you want the Sprite Sheet image to be exported
3. In the **Output** section:
   - Enable the option **Output File** and select the directory where you want the texture file to be saved;
   - Enable the option **JSON Data** and select the directory where you want the JSON data file to be saved (preferably in the same directory of the image)
   - Enable the option **Meta -> Tags**

Exporting using the Plugin
-----------------------------
1. Open the Aseprite Importer tab in Godot
2. Click the button **Import .aseprite** and select a file.
   - A common error can happen here: `Aseprite command was not found`. If this happens, the plugin couldn't find the Aseprite executable alone, so you need to provide it. Click on the Settings button in the top right corner, and input the path/command to run Aseprite. Select your `.aseprite` file again.
4. It's ready. The JSON file is selected automatically and you can proceed from step 3 below.


Importing to Godot
----------------------
1. Open the scene where you want to import the animations
2. Select the JSON Data file
3. Select the texture file if it has not been automatically loaded
4. Select which tags you want to be imported
5. Select the `AnimationPlayer` node where you want the animations to be added/modified
6. Select The `Sprite`/`Sprite3D` node you want to be affected by the animations
7. Press **Generate Animations**

Limitations
=======
- For now the plugin doesn't keep track of the selected files in the disk to automatically re-import the changes;
- It also is not integrated with the Godot's UndoRedo system.
